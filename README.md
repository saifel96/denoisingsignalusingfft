📊 Signal Processing Project Showcase: Cleaning Noisy Signals with FFT 📊

Excited to share a recent project where I delved into the fascinating world of signal processing! 🚀

I generated a sample signal combining two frequencies, visualized the clean and noisy versions, and then used Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to filter out the noise. Let's take a closer look at the journey:

1️⃣ Create a Sample Signal:


# Generating a sample signal
# ...

# Adding noise to the signal
# ...

# Plotting signals
# ...
2️⃣ Compute The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):

# Computing FFT
# ...

# Plotting clean and noisy signals in time and frequency domain
# ...
3️⃣ Use PSD to Filter Out Noise:


# Filtering out noise using Power Spectral Density (PSD)
# ...

# Plotting the filtered signal and comparing PSD before and after
# ...
This project was an incredible learning experience! Not only did I visualize the impact of noise on signals, but I also got hands-on experience using FFT and PSD to filter out unwanted elements.
