# Denoising signal using FFT


ðŸ“Š Signal Processing Project Showcase: Cleaning Noisy Signals with FFT ðŸ“Š

Excited to share a recent project where I delved into the fascinating world of signal processing! ðŸš€

I generated a sample signal combining two frequencies, visualized the clean and noisy versions, and then used Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to filter out the noise. Let's take a closer look at the journey:

1 Create a Sample Signal:

2 Compute The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):

3 Use PSD to Filter Out Noise:

4 Filtering out noise using Power Spectral Density (PSD)

5 Plotting the filtered signal and comparing PSD before and after

This project was an incredible learning experience! Not only did I visualize the impact of noise on signals, but I also got hands-on experience using FFT and PSD to filter out unwanted elements.
